Title: Lossless Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI Images using 3D U-Net <br />
Worked on a 3D Unet model that is an optimizing FCN model for semantic segmentation. To improve the accuracy and the optimization, a bounding box approach is used to augment with FCNs. Additionally, worked to validate and increase the accuracy the model by using a large dataset like MICCAI BraTS’20 through the use of an advanced and powerful GPU.Python was chosen for implementation, and the TensorFlow framework. The training was performed in a desktop with 16GB ram DDR5 10TH Gen core i7 8GB RTX3060 Ti. The dataset used to train and validate the proposed model is BraTS’20 MICCAI with a dimension of 240 × 240 × 155 for x × y × z.
