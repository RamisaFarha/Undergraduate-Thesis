Title: Lossless Segmentation of Brain Tumors from MRI Images using 3D U-Net <br />
Worked on a 3D Unet model that is an optimizing FCN model for semantic segmentation. To improve the accuracy and the optimization, a bounding box approach is used to augment with FCNs. Additionally, worked to validate and increase the accuracy the model by using a large dataset like MICCAI BraTS’20 through the use of an advanced and powerful GPU.Python was chosen for implementation, and the TensorFlow framework. The training was performed in a desktop with 16GB ram DDR5 10TH Gen core i7 8GB RTX3060 Ti. The dataset used to train and validate the proposed model is BraTS’20 MICCAI with a dimension of 240 × 240 × 155 for x × y × z. <br />
In this paper, we propose an approach to an efficient 3D U-net segmentation technique for MRI Images using a lossless
preprocessing of an MRI image dataset. Our proposal has the
advantage of an impressive reduction of the required GPU
memory for 3D Medical Image processing activities and that
too, with an enhanced performance which is evaluated by the
IoU (Intersection over Union) evaluation metric. Comprehensive
experiment results performed with MICCAI BraTS’20 exhibit
the viability of the presented strategy.
